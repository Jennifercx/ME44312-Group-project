For the various models the set-up is as follows:
split data into input and output

split data into test and train

loop over all product categories and make a model per category, and store the error_indices, y_true and y_pred

The plot function plots the y_true and y_pred for the selected model with a selectable product category

The plot_combinded function plots the selected error_index for all models and product categories
